# list-manipulation

This repository consists of the main methods for manipulating lists that I use on a daily basis. It's a good idea for front-end applications, but I wouldn't recommend it for performance-critical algorithms.

### Run it using the following comand:

- select the function that you want to test and pass the parameters, Ex: 

```js
 runFor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
```

- run the archive using the following command:

```js
 node index.js
```
